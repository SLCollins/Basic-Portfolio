            <hr>
            <p>
                My name is Stephanie Collins and I am currently a Masters of Information candidate at the University of Toronto. I am also enrolled 
                in the University of Toronto's Coding Boot Camp. My main passion is cybersecurity - both the technical aspects as well as related
                policies. I am hoping to begin a career as a programmer in Toronto where I live with my rabbit (pictured) and too many dogs.
                If you are an interested recruiter, please feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn.

                 This website and the projects it links to serve are examples of my work from the University of Toronto's Coding Boot Camp, and serve
                as my portfolio.
